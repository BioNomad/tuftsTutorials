## Setup 

For the following machine learning tutorials we will be using glioblastoma data from [cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=gbm_cptac_2021).
Before getting started you will need:

- Account on [Tufts HPC](https://access.tufts.edu/research-cluster-account)
- [VPN](https://access.tufts.edu/vpn) if accessing the HPC from off campus

## Navigate To The Cluster

Once you have an account and are connected to the VPN/Tufts Network, navigate to the [OnDemand Website](https://ondemand.pax.tufts.edu/) and log in with your tufts credentials. Once you are logged in you'll notice a few navigation options:

## Setting Up A Project Space

We are going to open an interactive app:

=== "R"

    Click on `Interactive Apps > RStudio Pax` and you will see a form to fill out to request compute resources to use RStudio on the Tufts HPC cluster. We will fill out the form with the following entries:

    - `Number of hours` : `3`
    - `Number of cores` : `1`
    - `Amount of memory` : `32GB`
    - `R version` : `4.0.0`
    - `Reservation for class, training, workshop` : `Default`
    - `Load Supporting Modules`: `curl/7.47.1 gcc/7.3.0 hdf5/1.10.4 boost/1.63.0-python3 libpng/1.6.37 java/1.8.0_60 libxml2/2.9.10 libiconv/1.16 fftw/3.3.2 gsl/2.6`


=== "Python"
    
    Click on `Interactive Apps > JupyterLab` and you will see a form to fill out to request compute resources to use JupyterLab on the Tufts HPC cluster. We will fill out the form with the following entries:

    - `Number of hours` : `3`
    - `Number of cores` : `1`
    - `Amount of memory` : `32GB`
    - `R version` : `4.0.0`
    - `Reservation for class, training, workshop` : `Default`
    - `Load Supporting Modules`: `curl/7.47.1 gcc/7.3.0 hdf5/1.10.4 boost/1.63.0-python3 libpng/1.6.37 java/1.8.0_60 libxml2/2.9.10 libiconv/1.16 fftw/3.3.2 gsl/2.6`

We will now need to create our project that we will work out of:

=== "R"

    Click `Lauch` and wait until your session is ready. Click `Connect To RStudio Server`, and you will notice a new window will pop up with RStudio. Now Create a new project:
    
    1. Go to `File` > `New Project`
    2. `New Directory`
    3. `New Project`
    4. Create a name for your project (e.g. `machine-learning`)
    5. `Create Project`
     
    In terminal, start setting up your directories:
    
    ``` bash
    mkdir data
    mkdir scripts
    mkdir results
    ```
    
    Now that we have our project set up we will need to download our data. In the `data` folder we will download our data and decompress it:
    
    ``` bash
    cd data
    wget https://cbioportal-datahub.s3.amazonaws.com/gbm_cptac_2021.tar.gz
    tar -xvf gbm_cptac_2021.tar.gz 
    cd ..
    ```


=== "Python"
    
    Click `Launch` and wait until your session is ready. Click `Connect to JupyterLab`, and you will notice a new window will pop up with JupyterLab. Now Create a new project:
    
    Open `Terminal` in the launcher window and start setting up your directories:
    
    ``` bash
    mkdir data
    mkdir scripts
    mkdir results
    ```
    
    Now that we have our project set up we will need to download our data. In the `data` folder we will download our data and decompress it:
    
    ``` bash
    cd data
    wget https://cbioportal-datahub.s3.amazonaws.com/gbm_cptac_2021.tar.gz
    tar -xvf gbm_cptac_2021.tar.gz 
    cd ..
    ```
