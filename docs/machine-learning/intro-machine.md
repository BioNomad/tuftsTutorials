## Introduction To Machine Learning

Machine learning, broadly speaking are algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data. 
Here we find that we can use machine learning for a few broad tasks:

- **Dimension Reduction** to reduce the number of variables we need to consider
- **Unsupervised Learning** identify patterns in data that are unlabelled
- **Classification** predict which class label an observation might have
- **Regression** assess the relationship between variables 


The following cheatsheet is also useful to understand when to use what method:
