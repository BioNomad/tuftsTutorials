# Introduction To Linear Regression

## Linear Regression

In a regression model assesses the relationship between two quantitative variables by fitting a line to the data. 
Using our glioblastoma data, we will assess the relationship between IDH1 gene expression (a gene commonly mutated in this type of cancer) 
and TMB score (a measure of mutational burden). You can use a regression model to determine:

- how strong the relationship between these two variables is
- the value of the dependent variable given the independent variable
