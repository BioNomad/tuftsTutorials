## Linear Regression

In a regression model assesses the relationship between two quantitative variables by fitting a line to the data. 
Using our glioblastoma data, we will assess the relationship between IDH1 gene expression (a gene commonly mutated in this type of cancer) 
and TMB score (a measure of mutational burden). You can use a regression model to determine:

- how strong the relationship between these two variables is
- the value of the dependent variable given the independent variable

A linear model follows the following formula:

$$ 
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
$$

!!! info "What do these terms mean?"
    - $y$: dependent variable
    - $\beta_0$: intercept (where $y$ = 0)
    - $\beta_1$: regression coefficient or slope
    - $X$: independent variable
    - $\epsilon$: error or our estimate (what is the variation in our regression coefficient)

This formula describes the best fit line for our data that tries to minimizes our error $\epsilon$:

## Pre-Processing

=== "R"

    Open an R script by going to `File` > `New File` > `R Script`. Save this script using a descriptive name, like `linear-model.R`. In the script use the following code:
    
    ```R
    ## Loading our packages
    ## Load the counts data
    ## Load the meta data
    .libPaths(c("/cluster/tufts/hpc/tools/R/4.0.0"))
    library(tidyverse)
    library(caret)
    
    counts <- read.csv(
      file="data/gbm_cptac_2021/data_mrna_seq_fpkm.txt",
      header = T,
      sep = "\t") 

    meta <- read.csv(
      file = "data/gbm_cptac_2021/data_clinical_sample.txt",
      skip=4,
      header = T,
      sep = "\t"
    )
    ```

=== "Python"
    
    Open a new notebook by going to `File` > `New` > `Notebook`. Save this script using a descriptive name, like `linear-model.ipynb`. In a code block enter:
    
    ```py
    ## Import our libraries
    ## Import our data set
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import statsmodels.api as sm
    import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
    from scipy import stats
    import statsmodels.stats.api as sms
    from statsmodels.compat import lzip

    counts = pd.read_csv(
        'data/gbm_cptac_2021/data_mrna_seq_fpkm.txt' ,
        sep = '\t')
    meta = pd.read_csv(
        'data/gbm_cptac_2021/data_clinical_sample.txt' , 
        sep = '\t',
        skiprows=4)
    ```

Now we will need to do some data cleaning before we plug this into our model:

=== "R"

    ```R
    ## Change the patient id column to match 
    ## column names in the counts df
    meta$PATIENT_ID = gsub("-",".",meta$PATIENT_ID)
    
    ## grab IDH1 gene expression
    idh1 = counts %>%
      filter(Hugo_Symbol == "IDH1") %>%
      select(-Hugo_Symbol) %>%
      t() %>%
      as.data.frame() %>%
      mutate(PATIENT_ID = rownames(.))
      
    colnames(idh1) <- c("IDH1","PATIENT_ID")
    
    ## merge meta data and IDH1 
    ## gene expression
    merged <- merge(
      meta,
      idh1,
      by="PATIENT_ID")
    ```

=== "Python"
    
    ```py
    ## Grab IDH1 row and transpose 
    ## ensure that patient id is a column
    ## and that IDH1 is the column name
    IDH1= counts.loc[counts["Hugo_Symbol"] == "IDH1",]
    IDH1 = IDH1.T
    IDH1["PATIENT_ID"] = IDH1.index
    IDH1.columns = ["IDH1","PATIENT_ID"]

    ## Grab TMB score
    ## merge IDH1 gene expression and TMB score
    ## merging this way ensures data are organized
    ## by patient 
    TMB= meta[['PATIENT_ID','TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS']]
    merged=pd.merge(IDH1,TMB,on="PATIENT_ID")
    merged = merged.set_index('PATIENT_ID')
    merged.head()
    ```
## Normalize/Create the Model

These data, IDH1 gene expression and TMB score are on two different scales. To ensure a fair comparison of these variables we will normalize (or bring our data to a common scale) our data:

=== "R"

    ```R
    ## create a normalization function
    ## apply this function to our data 
    ## to get data on a similar scale
    NormalizeData <- function(data){
      normalized = (data - min(data)) / (max(data) - min(data))
      return(normalized)
    }

    norm = as.data.frame(
      apply(merged %>% select(IDH1,TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS), 2,NormalizeData)
    )
    ```

=== "Python"
    
    ```py
    ## You might notice our data is on two 
    ## drastically different scales
    ## We will normalize our data

    def NormalizeData(data):
        normalized = (data - np.min(data)) / (np.max(data) - np.min(data))
        df = pd.DataFrame(normalized)
        return normalized

    norm = NormalizeData(merged)
    ```

Now we can fit our regression model!

=== "R"

    ```R
    ## fit our linear regression model
    model <- lm(TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS ~ IDH1, data = norm)
    
    ## let's plot our data
    ## with the predicted values
    ggplot(norm, aes(x=IDH1, y=TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS)) + 
      geom_point() +
      theme_bw() +
      ylab("TMB") +
      xlab("IDH1") +
      geom_smooth(method=lm)
    ```
    
    ![](images/r-linear-model-data.png)
    
=== "Python"
    
    ```py
    ## fit our linear regression model
    tmb = norm['TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS']
    idh1 = norm['IDH1'].astype(float)
    model = sm.OLS(tmb,idh1).fit()
    
    ## Let's plot our data
    ## along with the predictions from 
    ## our model
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    plt.plot(norm['IDH1'], norm['TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS'], 'o') 
    plt.plot(norm['IDH1'], model.predict(idh1), 'r', linewidth=2)
    plt.xlabel('IDH1')
    plt.ylabel('TMB NONSYNONYMOUS')

    plt.show()
    ```
    
    ![](images/python-linear-model-data.png)
    
    
## Model Results

To assess our model we will generate a summary of some important metrics:

=== "R"

    ```R
    summary(model)
    ```
    
    ```
    Call:
    lm(formula = TMB_NONSYNONYMOUS ~ IDH1, data = norm)

    Residuals:
         Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max

    F-statistic: 0.4109 on 1 and 97 DF,  p-value: 0.523
    ```
=== "Python"
    
    ```py
    model.summary()
    ```
    
    ```markdown

    ```
    
Let's cover what a few of these mean:

=== "R"

    - `Estimate` : the model's effect, so here we see that a one unit increase in IDH1 results in a 0.0344 decrease in 
    - `Std. Error` : standard error of our estimate
    - `t value` : test stastic - the larger the statistic, the less likely this effect occured by chance
    - `Pr(>|t|)` : pvalue that assesses the effect of IDH1 on TMB score if the null hypothesis of no effect were correct
    - `Multiple R-squared:` : $r^2$ value of model - how much of the TMB variability is explained by IDH1 - here it is 0.4%
    
=== "Python"
    
    - `coef` : the model's effect, so here a 
    - `std` : standard error of our estimate
    - `t` : test stastic - the larger the statistic, the less likely this effect occured by chance
    - `P>|t|` : pvalue that assesses the effect of IDH1 on TMB score if the null hypothesis of no effect were correct
    - `R-squared` : $r^2$ value of model - how much of the TMB variability is explained by IDH1 - here it is 0.4%

## Recap 

So what have we found? Well the model only explains 0.4% of our outcome variation and increased IDH1 expression seems to be associated with a minimal decrease in TMB. Additionally, our high p-value of `0.523` indicates that we should not reject the possibility that this effect was due to chance. 

## Assumptions

So we found that IDH1 gene expression is not a great feature to model an outcome of TMB score. However, what if you do get a low p-value, a good $r^2$ value, and a sizeable effect - are you in the clear? Not so fast, a linear model is limited by assumptions in our data:

- The data is normally distributed
- Homogeneity in the variances (Homoscedacity)
- Independence of your observations

### Testing Assumptions

Mathematically, we can assess Normality and Homoscedacity with the shapiro test and Breusch-Pagan test, respectively:

=== "R"

    ```R
    shapiro.test(norm$IDH1)
    ```
    
    ```
    Shapiro-Wilk normality test

    data:  norm$IDH1
    W = 0.95137, {==p-value = 0.001093==}
    ```
    
=== "Python"

    ```py
    stats.shapiro(norm['IDH1'])
    ```
    
    ```
    (0.9513656497001648, {==0.0010935224127024412==})
    ```

We note here a pvalue (highlighted) of less than `0.05` which indicates that our data deviates from a normal distribution. Now how about our homoscedacity?

=== "R"

    ```R
    lmtest::bptest(model)
    ```
    
    ```
    studentized Breusch-Pagan test

    data:  model
    BP = 0.72081, df = 1, {==p-value = 0.3959==}
    ```
    
=== "Python"

    ```py
    names = ['Lagrange multiplier statistic', 'p-value',
        'f-value', 'f p-value']
    test = sms.het_breuschpagan(model.resid, model.model.exog)
    lzip(names,test)
    ```
    
    ```
    [('Lagrange multiplier statistic', 0.7208106123366453),
    ({=='p-value', 0.39587814229097884)==},
    ('f-value', 0.7114286333891047),
    ('f p-value', 0.4010451501525186)]
    ```

Here we see that our pvalue is well above `0.05` indicating there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the variance of the residuals are constant - i.e. we do have Homogeneity in our variances.
