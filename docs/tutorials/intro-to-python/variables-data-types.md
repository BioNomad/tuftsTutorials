## Variables

In Python, we store values using names called variables. We can assign a variable with an `=` sign:

```
max_coverage = 6000
minCoverage = 35
antibiotic = 'Streptomycin'
antibiotic2 = 'Penicillin'
```
You will note a few things about variables:

- can incorporate letters, digits and underscores
- cannot start with a digit
- these are case sensitive

Variables, once we assign them to some value, can be passed into functions to accomplish certain tasks. Let's use the simplist use case, the `print()` function:

```
print('The maximum coverage is ', max_coverage)
```
```
The maximum coverage is  6000
```

!!! note
    variables are available to use between blocks. However, the order in which you run blocks matters so make sure to run your code blocks in order!
