# Project Management

Before we dive into R it is worth taking a moment to talk about project management. Often times data analysis is incremental and files build up over time resulting in messy directories:

Sifting through a non-organized file system can make it difficult to find files, share data/scripts, and identify different versions of scripts. To remedy this, It is reccomended to work within an R Project.

## R Project

To Create a new R project:

1. Go to `File` > `New Project`
2. `New Directory`
3. `New Project`
4. Create a name for your project (e.g. `new-project`)
5. `Create Project`

You will notice that your RStudio console switches to this project directory. When you log out of RStudio you can open this project again by clicking the `.Rproj` file in the project directory.
