## Background

Proteins are composed of amino acids and the way in which they are arranged determines the final shape of the protein. Proteins have the following levels of organization:

- **Primary Structure:** amino acid sequence
- **Secondary Structure**: amino acid sequences linked by hydrogen bonds
- **Tertiary Structure**: organization of secondary structures
- **Quaternary Structure**: organization of multiple amino acid chains
