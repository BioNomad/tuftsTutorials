## Background

Proteins are composed of amino acids and the way in which they are arranged determines the final shape of the protein. Proteins have the following levels of organization:

- **Primary Structure:** amino acid sequence
- **Secondary Structure**: amino acid sequences linked by hydrogen bonds
- **Tertiary Structure**: organization of secondary structures
- **Quaternary Structure**: organization of multiple amino acid chains

## Proteomics Data

!!! question ""

    In a tissue sample, whether it be from your skin, liver, heart, etc. - there are millions of protein molecules. So how does one determine which proteins are present in a particular sample?
    
Currently a popular high-throughput stategy to accomplish this is called **shotgun proteomics**, where:

- A protein sample is digested (broken apart) resulting in a peptide mixture
- Those peptides are separated with Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectra (LC-MS/MS)
- These spectra are compared to a protein sequence database to identify the peptides
